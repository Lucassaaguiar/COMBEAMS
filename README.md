## How to use COMBEAMS
COMBEAMS is a computer program written in Python for the design of shear stud connectors commonly located at the interface of steel-concrete composite beams. The _manual_ provides an overview of how the user can use the program.

## COMBEAMS Program Overview
The program was developed through computational code written in Python, version 3.8.8. The User Interface (GUI â€“ Graphical User Interface), depicted in the Figure below, was crafted using the Tkinter library. The choice of this library was driven by its excellent portability, enabling routines implemented with Tkinter to be seamlessly transferable across Linux, Unix, Windows, and Mac operating systems.

The main window has 6 different panels: 

* Section Details and Connectors Characteristics;
* Program Functions and Controls;
* Internal Forces or Moments Diagrams;
* Internal Resisting Forces or Moments Diagrams;
* Graphic Display of Connector Arrangement and Forces Diagrams;
* Numerical Results for Each Section.

The _manual_ will detail how the user can use the program interface.
